Update - AAPLNews provided byPomerantz LLPMar 22, 2023, 18:45 ETShare this article   Share this articleNEW YORK, March 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of Apple iPhone 7 owners that updated their devices from iOS 14 to iOS 15 and suffered a performance degradation in their devices following the update. Such device owners are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at [email protected] or 888-476-6529, ext. 7980.The investigation concerns whether Apple violated consumer protection laws or engaged in unlawful business practices in connection with the iOS 15 operating system update. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions.

Finally, in November 2022, Meta fired 11,000 people, or 13% of its staff, scaled back budgets, and shrunk its real estate footprint in the face of macro uncertainties.Again on March 14, 2023, Meta disclosed plans to downsize team strength by around 10,000 people and to close about 5,000 additional open roles to make it a better technology company and improve its financial performance amid macro uncertainties.CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that his restructuring plans focused on flattening its organizational structure, dumping lower-priority projects, and reducing hiring rates.Meta highlighted investing in building AI tools as ChatGPT adoption gains momentum worldwide. It emphasized how the last downsizing improved efficiency and reduced costs by cutting out duplicative work and helping execute its highest priorities faster.As of March 2023, Meta reportedly slashed the price of Quest Pro to fend off competition from Apple's upcoming MR headset launch. It also remained rattled by the success of ByteDance Ltd TikTok and had forgone projects to win back lost users to the popular Chinese social media platform.Story continuesMajor tech players saw huge losses in 2022, weighed by higher interest rates, high inflation, and uncertain economic conditions. Meta lost two-thirds of its value. Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) also lost half its value.Interestingly, Meta shares gained over 64% YTD, beating the broader index returns of 14.96%.Price Action: META shares closed higher by 2.24% at $204.28 on Thursday.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Learn MoreApple has been in fine form on the market, and a rumored product could help it sustain its impressive momentum.Apple (AAPL -0.98%) stock has been a solid performer on the stock market in 2023, with gains of 27% so far. Investment bank Goldman Sachs expects the technology giant to sustain its impressive rally and head higher thanks to a massive installed base of users, as well as the growth of its services business and innovation in new areas.Goldman gave Apple stock its first buy rating in almost six years. The stock has jumped over 300% since the investment bank's previous buy rating, and analyst Michael Ng, who is now covering the company, has a $199 price target on Apple. That points toward 25% upside from current levels. Ng believes that Apple's solid brand equity has helped the company build a huge user base, which would play a key role in driving growth in the company's high-margin services business.Given that Apple could reportedly be taking steps to boost its installed base further, it won't be surprising to see this tech stock surpass Goldman's price target and head higher in the long run. Let's look at one such potential catalyst that could send Apple stock higher in the long run.Apple can snatch more users from the Android ecosystemSupply chain rumors suggest that Apple could reportedly update the budget-friendly iPhone SE next year. According to noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple may use the iPhone 14's form factor for the next iPhone SE and may even give the device an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of the legacy liquid-crystal display (LCD).Apple released the current generation iPhone SE last year, equipping the device with 5G wireless capability and a 4.7-inch LCD screen. The device was launched at an opportune time, given rising inflation and macroeconomic uncertainties, which explains why the iPhone SE turned out to be a popular smartphone in 2022. According to Counterpoint Research, the iPhone SE ranked ninth on the list of 10 best-selling smartphones globally last year.The research firm estimates that the device captured 1.1% of global smartphone volumes in 2022. As an estimated 1.2 billion smartphones were shipped last year, the iPhone SE should have sold at least 13 million units, per Counterpoint. That would translate into just under 6% of Apple's overall shipments of 226 million units last year.The next iteration of this device could be more successful, given the updates that Apple is likely to bring in the form of a bigger screen and better display. These updates should help the company capitalize on the trend of users switching from Android devices to iPhones.On Apple's February earnings conference call, CFO Luca Maestri pointed out that the company saw ""record levels of switchers in India and in Mexico."" CEO Tim Cook also acknowledged the role played by switchers from Android to iOS in helping Apple hit an installed base of 2 billion devices. Apple ended 2022 with an 18.8% share of the global smartphone market, an increase of 1.5 percentage points over the prior year.Given that the rumored 2024 iPhone SE is expected to be priced around $500, Apple could continue to win over more customers from the Android ecosystem. That's because midrange Android smartphones are priced between $450 to $650, and the potential pricing of the next iPhone SE could be below the $608 average selling price (ASP) of 5G smartphones seen last year.All this indicates that Apple's installed base of iPhones could keep heading higher in the future. This should pave the way for stronger growth in the company's services business, apart from creating a new pool of customers that could upgrade to more expensive iPhones or even purchase other products in the long run.A better entry-level iPhone could be a boon in the long runAn estimated 910 million 5G smartphones were shipped in 2022, according to CCS Insights. That number is expected to jump to 1.39 billion units by 2025. At the same time, the ASP of 5G smartphones is expected to shrink and drop to $444 by 2026.So Apple would be doing the right thing by giving regular updates to its entry-level smartphone in the coming years, as it could play an important role in helping the company maintain its dominance in the 5G smartphone space. After all, midtier smartphones command just over a third of overall smartphone shipments globally.Apple controlled just over 29% of the 5G smartphone market a year ago. Having a solid midrange smartphone in its lineup will help Apple maintain its grip over the 5G smartphone market in the long run, especially considering the way this space is expected to grow.If Apple continues to hold even a quarter of the 5G smartphone market in 2025, its annual iPhone shipments could hit almost 350 million units (based on CCS Insights' 1.39 billion units shipment estimate). That would be a big improvement over last year's shipment of 226 million units. The iPhone generated just under $200 billion in revenue in 2022, which means the ASP of each unit was just over $883.If Apple's iPhone ASP declines even by 10% after three years to $795 amid growing competition, the company could generate $278 billion in iPhone revenue in 2025 if it does manage to move 350 million units during the year (based on the assumption made in the previous paragraph). That would be an improvement of 39% over Apple's 2022 iPhone revenue.Given that the iPhone is Apple's biggest source of revenue and produced 56% of its top line last quarter, a healthy bump in iPhone sales and the related increase in demand for its services business would give the company's top and bottom lines a boost in the long run. This is why savvy investors should consider buying this tech stock before it is too late.Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreYou might be surprised by some of these top picks on Robinhood.Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD) has changed the investing game with its easy-to-use app and commission-free trades, which pushed the rest of the industry to get rid of trading commissions.While the buzz around Robinhood might have waned since the trading boom during the pandemic, the platform is still popular with millennials, and that makes it a good source for investing ideas. Luckily, it lists the 100 most popular stocks on its site, providing insight into what its investors are buying.What follows are three top Robinhood stocks that are worth buying today.Image source: Getty Images.1. AirbnbLike Robinhood, Airbnb (ABNB -2.45%) is another disruptor enabled by the mobile economy. In Airbnb's case, it has disrupted the hotel industry, making home-sharing a mainstream concept around the world.As a stock, Airbnb has been volatile since late 2020 like the rest of the tech sector. But the business itself has delivered stellar results, bucking the broader trend in tech as the company has benefited from the economic reopening.In 2022, revenue jumped 40% to $8.4 billion, driving a 49% increase in free cash flow (FCF) to $3.4 billion, and it reported its first full year of profitability under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and net income at $1.9 billion. The business has become highly profitable as it has scaled up and laid off a quarter of its staff early in the pandemic.While Airbnb's growth should slow in 2023 as the reopening tailwinds fade, the company still has a number of competitive advantages and should continue to gain market share in the travel industry. The stock also looks well priced at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43, and it's even cheaper on an enterprise value/free cash flow basis.The company also benefits from higher interest rates because it earns interest on the funds it holds between bookings and stays, making it a good hedge amid higher interest rates.2. MicrosoftOver the last decade, Microsoft (MSFT -0.12%) has transformed itself under CEO Satya Nadella, leaving behind its reputation as a stodgy legacy tech company.Microsoft Azure, its cloud infrastructure service, has quickly grown into a juggernaut. It is the biggest part of its intelligent cloud segment, which is now the company's largest source of revenue and profits, and it has made products like its Office software available on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) products. Like other big tech companies, growth has slowed in this economy, but the company looks poised to lead the next major platform shift into artificial intelligence (AI). Thanks to its partnership with OpenAI, the start-up that created ChatGPT, Microsoft is rapidly deploying generative AI tools across its suite of products, including Azure, its Office productivity software suite, and its Edge browser. And its Bing search engine could take significant market share from Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google search engine with the help of ChatGPT.Besides its AI initiatives, Microsoft also offers a degree of diversification that none of its peers can, making it the safest bet of the tech giants' stocks. Its growth could be sluggish this year, but the recent round of layoffs should give its profitability a boost. Investors can expect the company to step on the gas pedal in AI, with a number of different ways to monetize the breakthrough technology.3. Realty IncomeYou might be surprised to find Realty Income (O 0.65%) in Robinhood's Top 100. The real estate investment trust (REIT) doesn't fit the profile of the growth and tech stocks that are most common on the list, but its placement shows how popular dividend stocks have become in the current bear market.Realty Income owns stand-alone, single-tenant properties, leasing to national and global chains like 7-Eleven and Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA). It's a reliable dividend payer with a yield of 5%. It has even raised its dividend during the last three recessions, showing its ability to deliver growth even during difficult economies.The company specializes in triple net leases, meaning tenants pay for property taxes, maintenance, and insurance, removing some of the risk of being a landlord. Its leases also come with regular rent increases, building in revenue growth for the company.Realty Income has added perks for dividend investors: It pays dividends monthly and has raised its payout 120 times over the last 29 years, meaning investors can expect a dividend increase approximately every three months. With a 5% yield, monthly payouts, and a long track record of dividend hikes in good times and bad, it's hard to find a better income stock than Realty Income.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors. Jeremy Bowman has positions in Airbnb. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Airbnb, Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft.

Shares of other regional banks, including First Republic Bank (FRC), Comerica (CMA), and KeyCorp (KEY), advanced. Large banks’ shares gained as well. Bank of America (BAC) shares climbed 5%, and Citigroup (C) shares picked up 4%. Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were also higher. The bank headlines and a cut in supplies coming from the Kurdistan region of Iraq sent oil futures soaring, boosting shares of fossil fuel-related companies. Analyst upgrades lifted shares of Corning (GLW) and Pinterest (PINS).   Cruise Line Shares Decline  Carnival Corporation (CCL) shares sank on the cruise operator’s lower-than-expected guidance. Shares of rivals Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) fell as well. Nike (NKE) was the worst-performing stock in the Dow on a report the athletic apparel giant is taking on Formula 1 star Max Verstappen's planned Max 1 clothing line over a trademark issue. Shares of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) lost ground on concerns about higher interest rates, which make tech stocks less attractive.Gold prices dropped. The U.S. dollar declined against the euro and pound, but gained versus the yen. Major cryptocurrencies traded lower as U.S. regulators filed charges against the Binance exchange. InvestopediaTake the Next Step to InvestAdvertiser Disclosure×The offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

Who, after all, could have predicted the rise of Facebook or the fall of Sears in 1992?Next: Check Your $2 Bills — They Could Be Worth Upwards of $4,500Advice: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Although you can’t predict the future, you can pick long-term stock investments based on a company’s financial health, ability to innovate and history of finding new ways to add value.While there are no certainties when it comes to prognostication, the following companies are well-positioned to continue their runs of success for 30 more years through 2053. Some are new as of the 21st century, others date back to the Industrial Revolution. None, however, appear to be running out of steam any time soon.Apple (AAPL)Although the market for smartphones and tablets is relatively young, it’s so well-established that it’s difficult to imagine it going anywhere anytime soon. And while Apple is almost certainly never going to achieve the sort of growth it did while it was creating that market, it’s also hard to see it ever falling out of the top three or four spots in smartphone sales. Throw in a massive cash reserve, a modest dividend and a history of spending cash on share buybacks, and this would appear to be a stock that gives you as much reason to believe it will be worth owning in 30 years as it is today.Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft might seem like a blast from the past to some, but the software company has actually positioned itself well for strong legacy businesses. Its software suite is virtually indispensable to many (if not most) businesses, and its ubiquitous Windows runs on just over 74% of the world’s desktop computers, according to Statista. But the company also has a toe in the social media pool with LinkedIn, it’s in the video-conferencing game with Skype, and its Azure cloud computing services are duking it out with Amazon for domination of an all-important and fast-growing market space. All told, Microsoft has a variety of strong verticals, each of which looks to be a key piece of the increasingly digital, service-based economy.Story continuesLive Richer Podcast: How To Leverage Your InvestmentsAlphabet (GOOGL)A stock that has never paid a dividend might feel out of place — the best dividend stocks tend to offer more confidence over long time frames. But Alphabet’s combination of a rock-solid business that completely dominates internet search alongside its investments in forward-looking “moon shots” could create the sort of massive disruptive value to take it beyond its current mega-cap status.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)Here you have a business that’s so essential to the American economy that when its major players do a truly horrendous job of it, the federal government steps in to lend the company hundreds of billions of dollars to ensure it stays in business. And as far as safe bets go, that makes the largest investment banks a pretty solid option. Businesses and consumers alike are always going to need banks — the economy grinds to a halt without them. And as such, America’s largest bank, with $3.2 trillion in assets, is likely among the safest bets for companies that aren’t going anywhere in the foreseeable future.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Johnson & Johnson was at the forefront of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment research, which showcased the 137-year-old company’s ability to continuously evolve and adapt. Health care, however, is just one arm of its operations.It’s also a massive consumer goods conglomerate with a huge portion of its business in the sort of consumer staples that are likely always going to be in demand. Is it possible that there will be a time when COVID-19 is a thing of the past and people are no longer paying huge bucks to private companies for their prescription drugs? Sure. Will those people still need to buy baby oil and mouthwash? Almost certainly.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)It’s hard to ignore the presumed favorite of Warren Buffett, who made his fortune buying and holding stock. In addition to owning some of America’s most recognized brands — Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom and Geico, to name a few — Berkshire Hathaway has tremendous value as an investment vehicle for Buffett himself.If that doesn’t convince you, consider this: The company has been on a stock repurchasing spree over the last couple of years. It bought back $24.7 billion in its own stock in 2020, followed by an additional $27.1 billion in 2021. Repurchases slowed a bit in 2022, but the company still bought back $7.9 billion of its shares, and it was on track to buy back $3 billion in the first quarter of 2023, according to Barron’s.Verizon (VZ)One of the biggest selling points for telecom stocks is usually the dividend, and Verizon doesn’t disappoint with a yield of nearly 7% — 6.97%, to be exact. If you’re reinvesting that over time, it can develop into a pretty significant chunk of your nest egg even if the stock’s market value underperforms over time.However, it’s also worth noting that Verizon and other wireless companies are in a pretty strong market position due to the enormous value of the wireless spectrum they own, which could make it a smart investment. With a limited amount of spectrum available for carriers — and the enormous cost of acquiring it — the business is not one where plucky young upstarts have much chance, if any, to challenge the status quo. So, Verizon might continue battling with AT&T, T-Mobile and others for market share, but it also seems pretty unlikely that the major players in that realm are going to change up entirely.AT&T (T)What’s one way to prevent disruptive new internet companies from undermining your business model? Be the business that supplies people with their internet connection. That’s clearly just one piece of AT&T’s business — it also owns WarnerMedia, which merged with Discovery to form a new company, and DirecTV, among other properties — but it’s another example of how high-dividend telecom stocks could be among the better bets for a stock that will be worth owning for the next 30 years. Worth noting is the generous dividend on AT&T shares, at 6.12%.The Walt Disney Co. (DIS)There aren’t many companies in the media and entertainment space you would normally consider for this sort of list. After all, consumer tastes are fickle, and you never know where the next hit might come from. However, Disney would be the exception that proves the rule. With a firmly established brand, a wide variety of additional media brands under its umbrella, the Disney+ streaming service and the combined media libraries of Disney, Fox and Marvel now under its control, Disney’s position in the American media landscape appears to be secure enough to survive the shifting sands of consumer tastes.The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)Legendary investor Peter Lynch is often quoted as saying, “Go for a business that any idiot can run — because sooner or later any idiot probably is going to be running it.” It’s hard to imagine sounder advice for picking stocks with a 30-year time frame, and one such business that could fit the bill might be Procter & Gamble.Operating in consumer staples is a great business model to start with, as the demand for your products never really subsides. And when you consider the sheer volume of different popular household brands under the P&G umbrella — Old Spice, Pantene, Crest, Vicks, Tide, Mr. Clean, Swiffer and Pampers, just to name a few — it’s hard to envision an idiot big enough to sink all of them at once.Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)A barrage of scandals battered Wells Fargo in recent years, but the bank survived, which proves the 171-year-old institution’s continued success as a wily survivor.While massive banks don’t have much room for growth, they do offer long-term stability thanks to the built-in advantages that come with financing the economy. Every company will have its share of ups and downs over the years, and Wells Fargo has done a good job of managing its many recent downs.The Home Depot (HD)The Home Depot has proven its strength through the toughest financial challenges in recent times — the market crash and the pandemic. And despite taking a few hits recently as interest rates have risen and home buying has slowed, it’s still a serious contender for the long haul, perhaps because of the pandemic as much as in spite of it. With few real competitors beyond Lowe’s, and people continuing to work from home offices in the locations of their choosing, Home Depot seems well-positioned to ride out whatever comes next.United Parcel Service (UPS)The rise of online retail meant a huge increase in business for parcel delivery, a pattern that the pandemic only strengthened. The trend away from brick-and-mortar retail is a gain for companies like UPS, which looks to be occupying an increasingly lucrative space between consumers and their stores. And of course, UPS was doing just fine with the parcel delivery business before Amazon and the like, so this is one company that appears more than likely to still be chugging along as we close in on 2053.NextEra Energy (NEE)As investments go, there are few sectors as stable as utilities. While you’re not going to get rich owning them, you’re also really unlikely to go broke. Operating a legally defined monopoly in most places, utilities don’t really have any competition to speak of. And given that people will always need electricity, that makes a company like NextEra Energy, with its 5.8 million accounts serving over 12 million customers, a pretty safe bet to still be rolling along in 30 years.The Coca-Cola Co. (KO)With a 61-year history of increasing dividends, currently at $1.84 per share annually, and a healthy yield of 3.07%, Coca-Cola is a reliable blue-chip worthy of a spot in your portfolio for the next 30 years.The company has a 46.3% share of the carbonated soft drink market, according to Statista — not surprising considering Coca-Cola owns 200 master brands and sells its products in over 200 countries. Although many of the most popular in the U.S. are soft drinks that get a bum rap for contributing to Americans’ sugar-laden diets, Coca-Cola products also include water, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages as well as coffee and tea.Morgan Stanley (MS)One more time with this broken record: America’s largest banks are as likely as any company to continue producing returns over a 30-year time frame. They’re essential to the economy and protected by the government. And while Morgan Stanley is a bit different in that it doesn’t have a commercial banking arm, it’s still in the realm of companies that you shouldn’t expect to be going anywhere. After all, it’s been in business since 1935.3M (MMM)3M is a Minnesota-based technology company that manufactures more than 60,000 industrial, safety and consumer products in a diverse collection of segments, including safety and industrial, transportation, electronics and healthcare. Perhaps best known by consumers for brands like Futuro, Filtrete and Scotch, 3M isn’t a sexy stock. But it is a stable one with relatively low volatility and consistent dividends, currently yielding an enviable 5.75%, which place it squarely in the dividend aristocrat category.Meta Platforms Inc. (FB)With a market cap of $529.62 billion, the company formerly known as Facebook could be the next in an elite group to reach a $1 trillion valuation. Although it has taken its share of hits over the last few years amid accusations of monopolistic tendencies and irresponsible behavior, Meta changed the way the world communicates so profoundly that it’s likely to survive whatever regulators and detractors throw at it — no matter how its VR ambitions play out.Amazon (AMZN)Love it or hate it, it’s tough to deny Amazon a place in your portfolio for the next 30 years. Having established itself as a retail powerhouse long before the pandemic, Amazon was well-positioned to serve as a lifeline for locked-down Americans. And not to be outdone by rival Walmart, Amazon has already ventured into the brick-and-mortar realm with Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods.Add in the company’s forays into consumer electronics, healthcare, streaming services and Amazon Web Services, which powers Amazon.com, and it’s clear that Amazon is an integral — and integrated — part of millions of Americans’ everyday lives.More From GOBankingRatesThe 15 Biggest Bank Failures in US HistoryFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterMaximize your savings with these 3 expert tipsTake Our Poll: How Do You File Your Taxes?John Csiszar, Andrew Lisa and Daria Uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Stocks To Keep in Your Portfolio for the Next 30 YearsRelated QuotesSymbolLast PriceChange% ChangeAMZNAmazon.com, Inc.97.24-0.80-0.82%TRENDING 1.

He holds a master's degree in finance and has extensive knowledge and experience in the area of trading, markets, and economics.Learn about our editorial policiesPublished March 28, 2023 Justin Sullivan / Getty ImagesApple Inc. (AAPL) is wading into the Buy Now, Pay Later sphere, as the low-barrier loan practice comes under closer scrutiny.Apple's program will allow customers to spread purchases over a six-week period with zero interest or fees. Plans for the program were unveiled at the company's World Wide Developer conference last year with an initial plan to roll it out in September 2022.Key TakeawaysThe flexible plan will allow users to borrow from $50 to $1,000.Payments can be tracked directly through Apple Wallet.Apple Financing will report Apple Pay Later loans to U.S. credit bureaus starting this fall.Select users will be able to use a pre-release version of the buy now, pay later service immediately, the company said Tuesday. Apple plans to roll out the program to all eligible users in months to come.Apple users can apply for a loan of $50 to $1,000 directly from Apple Wallet. A ""soft pull"" will be done and will not impact users' credit scores. The service will be provided by Apple Financing LLC, which will begin reporting payment information to U.S. credit bureaus beginning this fall.Users can then make a purchase with merchants that offer Apple Pay and track their payments directly in the Apple Wallet. Users will be able to track their ""buy now, pay later"" balances in multiple ways—the total amount due, the amount due within 30 days, and a calendar view will all be available. Users also will receive wallet alerts and email notifications when a due date is approaching.Apple is late to the buy now, pay later game. Companies like Affirm (AFRM), Afterpay and Klarna have popularized the service and are currently under financial pressure and regulator scrutiny.Online shopping that soared during the pandemic proved to be a boon for the major players in the space, which later saw fortunes turn last year. Klarna suffered a precipitous market valuation drop, and Affirm’s stock fell drastically from its 2021 peak.Regulators are keeping an eye on the industry, in hopes of making rules similar to those on traditional financial products. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has determined that buy now, pay later customers are often more financially vulnerable and are studying the industry. The government’s consumer watchdog has voiced concerns that programs like these encourage consumers to rack up too much debt.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Intel (INTC) was the best-performing stock in the Dow for the second day in a row. Shares of On Semiconductor (ON), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA) also rose. Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) shares increased 1%.Paycom Software (PAYC) shares jumped on an analyst upgrade, and upgrades also lifted shares of Walmart (WMT), Carnival Corporation (CCL), Philip Morris International (PM), and Fluence Energy (FLNC).Strong quarterly results sent shares of electric vehicle (EV) charging station maker EVgo (EVGO) up 22%. Shares of solar power equipment manufacturer SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) moved higher.   Tougher Banking Rules  Regional banks dominated the list of worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 as the White House proposed tougher rules on mid-sized banks following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Shares of First Republic Bank (FRC), Zions Bancorporation (ZION), KeyCorp (KEY), Comerica (CMA), and M&T Bank (MTB) were among the decliners. Shares of Charles Schwab (SCHW) dropped on an analyst downgrade. Wells Fargo (WFC) shares were lower after regulators fined the bank for violating U.S. sanctions.Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) shares sank to an all-time low as the struggling retailer announced a new stock sale and warned that, if it didn't succeed, the company could face bankruptcy. Match Group (MTCH) shares tumbled after a class action lawsuit was filed involving its dating app Tinder. Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) lost ground.Oil and gold futures climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell. The U.S. dollar dipped against the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were in the red.InvestopediaTake the Next Step to InvestAdvertiser Disclosure×The offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

匯銀：新台幣下半年重返「2」字頭美國近期公布的多項經濟數據走弱，強化投資人對於經濟走向衰退的看法，再加上預期升息循環進入尾聲，美元指數走弱，新台幣兌美元匯價今天(21日)止貶回升。匯銀認為，今年美元的高點已經回不去，下半年新台幣有機會重返「29」字頭。 美國最新公布的通膨數據略低於市場預期，美元相對G10國的貨幣也進一步走軟，美元指數上周下跌0.5%，新興市場貨幣升值，這周是美國企業財報周，幾家大型企業公布的財報數據，再度強化投資人對於經濟走向衰退的看法。電動車大廠特斯拉公布2年來最低單季利潤率，且表示將繼續降價，股價暴跌近1成。另外，電信股AT&T由於第1季營收和自由現金流未達到市場預期，股價則重挫超過1成。 台新銀行首席外匯策略師陳有忠指出，由於各界預期，美元升息已經接近尾聲，目前來看，美元在今年的高點已過，接下來會走緩貶的模式。陳有忠分析，美國矽谷銀行以及歐洲瑞士信貸危機，對於銀行業還是不定時炸彈，危機還沒有解除，因此金融市場動盪，美元目前還是市場最大需求，因此，即便升息接近尾聲，對於美元仍有支撐。不過，美元今年的高點已過，下半年新台幣有機會重返「29」字頭，預期新台幣兌美元匯價，下半年的成交區間會介於29.5Reactions1時報資訊·19

該公司不但擁有眾多品牌客戶包括戴爾、惠普、IBM與各家國際系統整合商(SI)，且在白牌市場中的滲透率也持續升高。今年儘管因不景氣導致伺服器市況未如預期，但預估仍有個位數成長，法人預估川湖上半年業績將較同期衰退逾2成，下半年進入反攻期。 值得注意的是，受惠ChatGPT帶動AI浪潮，川湖AI伺服器訂單相對強勁，在上半年產業動盪的時刻不減反增，成為後市帶動業績成長的一支伏兵。此外，上半年市場庫存去化告一段落之後，下半年補庫存效應將浮現，加上伺服器新平台推出，將優化市況發展。 法人預估，川湖下半年單季營收將重回20億元大關，並在第三季以23-24億元的水準刷新歷史紀錄，第四季維持鉅亨網·22

It has come a long way from its humble beginnings. College dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded the company in 1976 with a vision of shrinking the size of computers so everyone could have them in their homes and businesses.Today, many of us hold an Apple-branded computer product in the palm of our hand. The company has developed many widely successful products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple continues to invest heavily in product innovation to upgrade its offerings and stay ahead of the competition.Image source: AppleIn addition to technology products, Apple has a growing services business (e.g., iCloud, AppleTV+, and Apple Music). The company's streaming platforms, cloud solutions, and other services generate recurring revenue, helping offset some of the variability of product sales. The company's service offerings are growing faster than product revenue. They also deliver higher margin revenue for Apple, making them an important profit growth driver for the company.The Apple ecosystem of products and services has created unparalleled customer loyalty. Apple fans will often purchase the latest version of its iPhone as soon as it's available. They stay subscribed to its growing number of services, helping steadily increase revenue, earnings, and cash flow. The growth should enable Apple stock to continue its upward climb in the future.Here's a step-by-step on how to buy shares of Apple and some factors to consider before investing in the technology stock.How to buy Apple stockYou can buy shares of Apple in any brokerage account. If you still need to open one, these are some of the best-rated brokers and trading platforms.

Here are some reasons why you might want to consider buying Apple stock:You love Apple's products and want to invest in the company that makes them.You believe Apple's shares can continue to outperform the S&P 500.You understand how Apple makes money.You think Apple can continue developing innovative products that increase its revenue, income, and free cash flow at healthy rates.You believe Apple can continue growing its higher-margin services offerings at a strong pace.You want to invest in a financially strong company.You want to earn some dividend income and believe Apple can continue growing its payout.You think Apple does a great job allocating its copious cash flows to increase shareholder value, including its preference for share repurchases.You believe Apple's strategic investments in digital content, payment processing, cloud services, and advertising will accelerate growth.You have faith that CEO Tim Cook can continue growing shareholder value.You understand the risks of investing in Apple stock, including that it could lose value.On the other hand, here are some factors to think about that might lead you to decide against buying Apple stock:You're not a fan of Apple's products.You're not sure Apple can outperform the market.You think Apple's days of product innovation are in the rear-view mirror.You need a higher dividend yield than Apple currently offers.You are a younger investor and want to invest in a company earlier in its growth cycle than Apple.You're worried about the economy and think a recession could affect demand for Apple products.You're concerned that a competitor could start eating into Apple's dominant share of the smartphone market.How to Invest in Microsoft StockGet step-by-step guidance on how to invest in MSFT stock and learn the ins and outs of this major tech company.Investing in FAANG or MAMAA StocksThis acronym describes prominent tech companies that are essential to the S&P 500.Who Is Tim Cook?Apple CEO Tim Cook has moved past being the ""successor to Steve Jobs.""Investing in Streaming Service StocksSubscription streaming services make up a huge part of the entertainment industry.Is Apple profitable?Income growth helps fuel stock price appreciation over the longer term. It's an ideal area for beginning investors to focus on before buying shares of any company.Apple is an extremely profitable company. It recorded $394 billion of revenue and $99.8 billion of net income in its 2022 fiscal year. Revenue increased by 7.8%, while earnings grew by 5.4% from the previous year. Apple's steadily rising profits have helped drive its stock price skyward over the years:Image source: Ycharts.Apple generates most of its revenue from selling products (80% in 2022). However, services are an important profit growth driver. Services revenue is growing faster than product revenue (14.2% versus 6.3% in 2022) and has a higher gross margin (72% versus 36%). It's growing into a meaningful profit contributor, with services supplying 33% of Apple's gross profit on only 20% of its revenue.Apple's income should continue to rise. The technology giant is investing heavily in developing innovative products that its fans must have as soon as they become available. It also continues expanding its service offerings, providing the company with more recurring revenue.Apple does an excellent job of converting revenue into cash flow. The technology titan generated $122.2 billion of cash from operating activities in 2022. That gave it the funds to invest in growing its business and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining one of the strongest financial profiles in the world.Does Apple pay a dividend?Apple has paid a dividend on its stock since reinstating the payout in 2012. The company started paying dividends in 1987 but suspended the payout in 1995. Since reinstating the shareholder payout a decade ago, Apple has increased its dividend every year. Apple paid $14.8 billion in dividends in 2022.In addition to paying dividends, Apple repurchases a significant amount of its stock each year. Apple spent $89.4 billion on share repurchases in 2022. The repurchases reduced its outstanding shares by 3.2%.ETFs with exposure to AppleInstead of actively buying shares of Apple directly, you can passively invest in the technology company through a fund holding its shares.As of early 2023, Apple was the biggest company in the world by market capitalization; it's a widely held stock. Apple is in several stock market indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index. As a result, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that benchmark their returns against those indexes hold Apple stock.According to ETF.com, 420 ETFs held 1.2 billion shares of Apple as of early 2023. The ETFs with the most shares were:Data source: ETF.com. State Street Global Advisors Trust Company, Blackrock, Vanguard, and Invesco. Exchange-traded FundAssets under managementApple shares heldFund WeightingPosition rankingSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT:SPY)$353.5 billion160.6 million7.09%LargestiShares Core S&P 500 (NYSEMKT:IVV)$296.1 billion133.7 million7.07%LargestInvesco QQQ Trust (NYSEMKT:QQQ)$164.4 billion130.0 million12.34%2nd largestVanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO)$272.4 billion120.4 million6.60%LargestVanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEMKT:VTI)$270.6 billion102.8 million5.60%LargestGiven its gargantuan size, even the world's largest ETFs have a meaningful portfolio weighting to Apple stock. Of the top-five ETFs by assets under management, the Invesco QQQ Trust has the highest portfolio weighting to Apple at 12.34%, making the fund a potentially attractive way to gain passive exposure to Apple stock.Another relatively large ETF with an even higher portfolio weighting to Apple stock is the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK  -0.32%) at 23% of the fund's holding, giving investors even greater exposure to Apple stock.Will Apple stock split?As of early 2023, Apple had yet to announce an upcoming stock split. Here's a snapshot of Apple's stock split history:Data source: Apple. DateType of stock splitAugust 20204-for-1June 20147-for 1February 20052-for-1June 20002-for-1June 19872-for-1Apple's stock price was around $500 a share right before its last stock split.

It's among the world's most popular games, with more than 350 million active accounts.The company's epic hit game isn't the only thing going for the game-maker. Epic also developed the Unreal Engine, which drives many of the world's leading games. Several other industries utilize the technology, including films and television, architecture, automotive, manufacturing, and simulation. The Unreal Engine also drives the company's Epic Games Store and Epic Online services. This integrated platform enables developers and creators to build, distribute, and operate games and other digital content.Image Source: Epic GamesThe company's uber-popular game and gaming engine generate epic amounts of revenue. You might even be among the millions who have spent money on the company's platform, which might have you wondering how to invest in the company and get a slice of its upside potential.Here's a look at how to invest in Epic Games and some factors to consider before investing in the company.Is Epic Games publicly traded?Is Epic Games publicly traded?As of early 2023, Epic Games had not completed an initial public offering (IPO), so investors can't buy the company's shares on a stock exchange with their brokerage account.Who owns Epic Games?Who owns Epic Games?Epic Games is a privately held company owned by:Tim Sweeney: Founder and CEO Tim Sweeney owns more than half of Epic Games' stock.Tencent (TCEHY  -2.37%): The Chinese technology and entertainment company holds about 40% of Epic Games stock.Sony (SONY  0.73%): The Japanese entertainment company has about a 4.9% stake in Epic Games.Kirkbi: The holding company that owns The Lego Group has a 3% interest in Epic Games.Will Epic Games IPO?Will Epic Games IPO?Epic Games didn't have an IPO on the calendar as of early 2023. There has been speculation since 2021 that the company would complete an IPO. Some people think 2023 could finally be the year Epic Games will complete its IPO.However, the IPO market has been in a deep freeze due to rising interest rates, a slowing economy, and banking sector issues. Epic Games might wait until the IPO market heats back up before launching an IPO.How to invest in Epic GamesHow to invest in Epic GamesWhile you can't invest directly in Epic Games until it launches an IPO, you can get some exposure to the company's upside by investing in one of the two publicly traded companies that own shares: Tencent or Sony. Chinese tech and entertainment titan Tencent trades on the OTC market, enabling anyone to buy shares through their brokerage account. Global technology and entertainment behemoth Sony trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Tencent has the most exposure to Epic, given that it holds 40% of the company's shares. However, that's a small piece of its massive communications, digital content, and financial technology (fintech) services platform. Tencent has invested in more than 800 companies, including the Chinese super app WeChat and U.S. game maker Activision (ATVI  -0.05%).Likewise, Epic is a small part of Sony's empire. The company is one of the largest electronic products makers, the top video game console producer (PlayStation), and the biggest video game publisher. Sony Entertainment is also one of the biggest music publishers, a leading record label, and a top film studio.For people who really want to own a small slice of Epic Games, Tencent or Sony are currently the only way to gain exposure to the company until it completes an IPO.Alternatives to investing in Epic GamesAlternatives to investing in Epic GamesAnother option to consider is investing in a different video game stock. Alternatives include:Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -0.12%): Take-Two Interactive developed the hit game franchises Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K, and Red Dead Redemption.Electronic Arts (EA  0.24%): EA is the company behind leading sports franchises Madden and FIFA.Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX): Roblox's online platform and storefront enable users to play games developed by other users.Should I invest in Epic Games?Should I invest in Epic Games?Although you can't invest in Epic games yet, here are some factors to consider before investing in the company if it launches an IPO in the future.Is Epic Games profitable?Is Epic Games profitable?Because Epic Games is a private company, there is little publicly available information about its finances. However, according to documents released by Apple (AAPL  -0.98%) relating to a legal battle to get Fortnight on the App Store, Epic Games isn't yet profitable. The company reportedly lost between $100 million and $200 million annually from 2019 through 2021.It's common for growing technology companies to lose money. They're typically investing heavily in new products. In Epic's case, it's investing in expanding its Epic Games Store and developing new games.Epic Games' revenueEpic Games' revenueAccording to Statista, Epic Games generated more than $6 billion of revenue in 2022. That included sales within Fortnite and revenue from its Unreal gaming engine. Epic Games reported that PC players spent $820 million on the Epic Games Store in 2022.That's a lot of money. It's more revenue than some rival publicly-traded gaming companies. For example, Take-Two Interactive generated $3.5 billion of net revenue in fiscal year 2022; Roblox's revenue was $2.2 billion in 2022. EA had higher sales at $7.5 billion of net bookings in fiscal 2022.Epic Games valuationEpic Games valuationEpic Games raised $2 billion in additional funding in early 2022 when Sony and Kirkbi each invested $1 billion into the company to fund building a metaverse for kids. That latest funding round gave the company a valuation of $31.5 billion.To put the company's private market value into some context, it rivals many other publicly traded game makers. EA was only slightly more valuable at a $32.5 billion market cap in early 2023. Meanwhile, Roblox had a $26 billion market value, and Take-Two's market valuation was almost $20 billion.Investing in Entertainment StocksEntertaining people across media is what these top companies do.Investing in Sports StocksAlways popular, sports are also a moneymaker. Play along with these top companies.How to Buy IPO StockSo that hot company just went public. How do you buy in?Investing in Streaming Service StocksSubscription streaming services make up a huge part of the entertainment industry.The bottom line on investing in Epic GamesThe bottom line on investing in Epic GamesYou can't buy shares of Epic Games yet because it hasn't completed an IPO. However, you can gain exposure to the company by investing in one of its major shareholders. You could also invest in the upside of the video game industry through another game maker. The alternative options could enable you to make money investing in the gaming market until Epic launches what would likely be an epic IPO, given the popularity of Fortnite and its Unreal Engine.Matthew DiLallo has positions in Apple.

this:’ One of China’s most popular apps has the ability to spy on its users, say experts    			By Nectar Gan, Yong Xiong and Juliana Liu, CNN		  Updated        5:16 AM EDT, Mon April 3, 2023                Link Copied!         Experts say one of China's most popular apps can spy on its users                            03:32                         - Source:                CNNCNN         —           It is one of China’s most popular shopping apps, selling clothing, groceries and just about everything else under the sun to more than 750 million users a month.        But according to cybersecurity researchers, it can also bypass users’ cell phone security to monitor activities on other apps, check notifications, read private messages and change settings.        And once installed, it’s tough to remove.        While many apps collect vast troves of user data, sometimes without explicit consent, experts say e-commerce giant Pinduoduo has taken violations of privacy and data security to the next level.        In a detailed investigation, CNN spoke to half a dozen cybersecurity teams from Asia, Europe and the United States — as well as multiple former and current Pinduoduo employees — after receiving a tipoff.        Multiple experts identified the presence of malware on the Pinduoduo app that exploited vulnerabilities in Android operating systems. Company insiders said the exploits were utilized to spy on users and competitors, allegedly to boost sales.        “We haven’t seen a mainstream app like this trying to escalate their privileges to gain access to things that they’re not supposed to gain access to,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm.        “This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.”           This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.                Mikko Hyppönen, cybersecurity expert              Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software developed to steal data or interfere with computer systems and mobile devices.        Evidence of sophisticated malware in the Pinduoduo app comes amid intense scrutiny of Chinese-developed apps like TikTok over concerns about data security.         Some American lawmakers are pushing for a national ban on the popular short-video app, whose CEO Shou Chew was grilled by Congress for five hours last week about its relations with the Chinese government.        The revelations are also likely to draw more attention to Pinduoduo’s international sister app, Temu, which is topping US download charts and fast expanding in other Western markets. Both are owned by Nasdaq-listed PDD, a multinational company with roots in China.        While Temu has not been implicated, Pinduoduo’s alleged actions risk casting a shadow over its sister app’s global expansion.         There is no evidence that Pinduoduo has handed data to the Chinese government. But as Beijing enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, there are concerns from US lawmakers that any company operating in China could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities.   Pinduoduo's parent company PDD is listed on the Nasdaq in New York.Mike Segar/Reuters/File      The findings follow Google’s suspension of Pinduoduo from its Play Store in March, citing malware identified in versions of the app.        An ensuing report from Bloomberg said a Russian cybersecurity firm had also identified potential malware in the app.        Pinduoduo has previously rejected “the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious.”        CNN has contacted PDD multiple times over email and phone for comment, but has not received a response.      Rise to success       Pinduoduo, which boasts a user base that accounts for three quarters of China’s online population and a market value three times that of eBay                            (EBAY), wasn’t always an online shopping behemoth.          Founded in 2015 in Shanghai by Colin Huang, a former Google employee, the startup was fighting to establish itself in a market long dominated by e-commerce stalwarts Alibaba                            (BABA) and JD.com                            (JD).        It succeeded by offering steep discounts on friends-and-family group buying orders and focusing on lower-income rural areas.        Pinduoduo posted triple digit growth in monthly users until the end of 2018, the year it listed in New York. By the middle of 2020, though, the increase in monthly users had slowed to around 50% and would continue to decline, according to its earnings reports.   Colin Huang, a former Google employee, founded Pinduoduo in 2015 in Shanghai. He  stepped down as CEO in 2020 and resigned as chairman the following year.VCG/VCG/Getty Images/File      It was in 2020, according to a current Pinduoduo employee, that the company set up a team of about 100 engineers and product managers to dig for vulnerabilities in Android phones, develop ways to exploit them — and turn that into profit.         According to the source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, the company only targeted users in rural areas and smaller towns initially, while avoiding users in megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai.        “The goal was to reduce the risk of being exposed,” they said.        By collecting expansive data on user activities, the company was able to create a comprehensive portrait of users’ habits, interests and preferences, according to the source.        This allowed it to improve its machine learning model to offer more personalized push notifications and ads, attracting users to open the app and place orders, they said.        The team was disbanded in early March, the source added, after questions about their activities came to light.        PDD didn’t reply to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on the team.      What experts found      Approached by CNN, researchers from Tel Aviv-based cyber firm Check Point Research, Delaware-based app security startup Oversecured and Hyppönen’s WithSecure conducted independent analysis of the 6.49.0 version of the app, released on Chinese app stores in late February.        Google Play is not available in China, and Android users in the country download their apps from local stores. In March, when Google suspended Pinduoduo, it said it had found malware in off-Play versions of the app.        The researchers found code designed to achieve “privilege escalation”: a type of cyberattack that exploits a vulnerable operating system to gain a higher level of access to data than it’s supposed to have, according to experts.        “Our team has reverse engineered that code and we can confirm that it tries to escalate rights, tries to gain access to things normal apps wouldn’t be able to do on Android phones,” said Hyppönen.  In China, about three quarters of smartphone users are on the Android system.Luo Yunfei/China News Service/VCG/Getty Images      The app was able to continue running in the background and prevent itself from being uninstalled, which allowed it to boost its monthly active user rates, Hyppönen said. It also had the ability to spy on competitors by tracking activity on other shopping apps and getting information from them, he added.        Check Point Research additionally identified ways in which the app was able to evade scrutiny.        The app deployed a method that allowed it to push updates without an app store review process meant to detect malicious applications, the researchers said.        They also identified in some plug-ins the intent to obscure potentially malicious components by hiding them under legitimate file names, such as Google’s.        “Such a technique is widely used by malware developers that inject malicious code into applications that have legitimate functionality,” they said.

Apple                            (AAPL)’s iPhone has 25% market share, according to Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities.        Sergey Toshin, the founder of Oversecured, said Pinduoduo’s malware specifically targeted different Android-based operating systems, including those used by Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo.        CNN has reached out to these companies for comment.        Toshin described Pinduoduo as “the most dangerous malware” ever found among mainstream apps.        “I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive,” he said.        Most phone manufacturers globally customize the core Android software, the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), to add unique features and applications to their own devices.         Toshin found Pinduoduo to have exploited about 50 Android system vulnerabilities. Most of the exploits were tailor made for customized parts known as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code, which tends to be audited less often than AOSP and is therefore more prone to vulnerabilities, he said.        Pinduoduo also exploited a number of AOSP vulnerabilities, including one which was flagged by Toshin to Google in February 2022. Google fixed the bug this March, he said.          I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive.                Sergey Toshin, Android security expert              According to Toshin, the exploits allowed Pinduoduo access to users’ locations, contacts, calendars, notifications and photo albums without their consent. They were also able to change system settings and access users’ social network accounts and chats, he said.        Of the six teams CNN spoke to for this story, three did not conduct full examinations. But their primary reviews showed that Pinduoduo asked for a large number of permissions beyond the normal functions of a shopping app.        They included “potentially invasive permissions” such as “set wallpaper” and “download without notification,” said René Mayrhofer, head of the Institute of Networks and Security at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria.

Even though the analysis didn’t directly name the shopping giant, the report spread quickly among other researchers, who did name the company. Some of the analysts followed up with their own reports confirming the original findings.        Soon after, on March 5, Pinduoduo issued a new update of its app, version 6.50.0, which removed the exploits, according to two experts who CNN spoke to.        Two days after the update, Pinduoduo disbanded the team of engineers and product managers who had developed the exploits, according to the Pinduoduo source.        The next day, team members found themselves locked out of Pinduoduo’s bespoke workplace communication app, Knock, and lost access to files on the company’s internal network. Engineers also found their access to big data, data sheets and the log system revoked, the source said.        Most of the team were transferred to work at Temu. They were assigned to different departments at the subsidiary, with some working on marketing or developing push notifications, according to the source.        A core group of about 20 cybersecurity engineers who specialize in finding and exploiting vulnerabilities remain at Pinduoduo, they said.        Toshin of Oversecured, who looked into the update, said although the exploits were removed, the underlying code was still there and could be reactivated to carry out attacks.       Oversight failure      Pinduoduo has been able to grow its user base against a backdrop of the Chinese government’s regulatory clampdown on Big Tech that began in late 2020.        That year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a sweeping crackdown on apps that illegally collect and use personal data.         In 2021, Beijing passed its first comprehensive data privacy legislation.         The Personal Information Protection Law stipulates that no party should illegally collect, process or transmit personal information. They’re also banned from exploiting internet-related security vulnerabilities or engaging in actions that endanger cybersecurity.        Pinduoduo’s apparent malware would be a violation of those laws, tech policy experts say, and should have been detected by the regulator.         “This would be embarrassing for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, because this is their job,” said Kendra Schaefer, a tech policy expert at Trivium China, a consultancy. “They’re supposed to check Pinduoduo, and the fact that they didn’t find (anything) is embarrassing for the regulator.”        The ministry has regularly published lists to name and shame apps found to have undermined user privacy or other rights. It also publishes a separate list of apps that are removed from app stores for failing to comply with regulations.        Pinduoduo did not appear on any of the lists.          They’re supposed to check Pinduoduo, and the fact that they didn’t find (anything) is embarrassing for the regulator.                Kendra Schaefer, tech policy expert               CNN has reached out to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Cyberspace Administration of China for comment.        On Chinese social media, some cybersecurity experts questioned why regulators haven’t taken any action.        “Probably none of our regulators can understand coding and programming, nor do they understand technology. You can’t even understand the malicious code when it’s shoved right in front of your face,” a cybersecurity expert with 1.8 million followers wrote last week in a viral post on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform.        The post was censored the next day.    CNN’s Kristie Lu Stout and Sean Lyngaas contributed reporting.

The VR/AR device will be the first new major product release from Apple since it debuted its first-generation AirPods seven years ago. To say the headset is an important product for the company is an understatement.But the device, which Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says will be called either the Reality Pro or Reality One, is coming at a rocky time for VR/AR and the metaverse as a whole. Between a lack of engaging content and companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Disney (DIS) shuttering divisions behind their own metaverse efforts, Apple will have its work cut out for it in ensuring that its product is a success.“A fully realized Metaverse is still at least a decade away,” explained Ramon Llamas, research director for International Data Corporation’s devices and displays team.“And I don't think it's possible for any company, even if you're Apple, to come in and say, ‘Here's our very first VR headset or AR headset,’ and then say, ‘Okay, now we have a metaverse.’ ”Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures at the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14 range in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., September 16, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew KellyAnd while Apple has a proven track record of breaking into established markets and revolutionizing them, this will surely be its most difficult test yet.Apple has proven its mettle beforeSo far, Meta (META) is the undisputed leader in the AR/VR space. The company, according to The Verge, has sold 20 million Quest headsets to date and controlled 81% of global market share as of Q4 2022, according to CounterPoint Research.But Apple has entered and taken over markets dominated by other firms before. Remember BlackBerry? The iPhone all but ended that company’s reign. Fitbit? It got bought up by Google after losing ground to the Apple Watch, which is now the industry leader. The iPad is the go-to tablet, and AirPods revolutionized truly wireless earbuds.Apple’s Reality headset, which Bloomberg reports will cost $3,000, could be another Apple product that upends an existing industry and, in turn, drives greater interest in the metaverse.Story continuesAnd while the company might not be able to manifest an entire metaverse on its own, its entry could be the jumping off point to getting there.“That could very well be a watershed moment for the metaverse and how people think about it,” Scott Kessler, Third Bridge global sector lead for tech, media, and telecom, told Yahoo Finance Live.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.Apple, however, will have to overcome some major roadblocks if its headset is going to be a success. First off, companies are already beginning to pull back on their metaverse efforts. Microsoft is paring its metaverse initiatives, according to The Information, as is Disney, which is shutting down its metaverse division.And while Meta is still investing heavily in the metaverse — it changed its name to reflect the fact that the initiative is its main focus — it’s recently turned its focus to its AI.The metaverse is still a foggy conceptThe metaverse itself has two real problems standing in its way. The first is that the entire concept has never been made clear for people to grasp. The second? Everything we’ve been told to expect is still years away from becoming a reality.“It does seem like it’s kind of amorphous, and there are other opportunities that seem, not just more near term, but more appealing,” Kessler said.Depending on who you ask, the metaverse is a series of interconnected online worlds that will eventually allow us to move seamlessly across the web using a single avatar, or something more akin to Roblox. Heck, your smartphone could be considered a gateway to the metaverse.It’s that ambiguity, though, that makes selling the idea to consumers so difficult.“We've got so caught up as to what the metaverse could be, but we’ve totally lost sight of what we're able to do,” said Llamas.In other words, metaverse companies have pitched hanging out in a virtual world inhabited by digital avatars of our friends, but it isn’t quite ready for prime time.All of that said, Apple’s entrance into the race could provide just the kind of boost the industry needs to help both AR/VR and the metaverse truly take off.Now we just have to wait until WWDC to find out if that comes to fruition.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Chopra said.""There is so much concentrated in a few major cloud providers. So ultimately there needs to be a look at resilience, but also financial stability. And in as much that the financial regulators need to take action, I think we have to seriously consider that.""In October 2021, the CFPB ordered six tech firms — Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (META), Google (GOOGL), PayPal (PYPL), and Square (SQ) — to provide information about their business practices, including data collection, policies for removing individuals from platforms, and policies for monitoring fraud and addressing consumer disputes.The bureau is also looking at Chinese payment platforms WeChat and Alipay.Rohit Chopra, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, testifies before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee during a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, December 15, 2022. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger for The Washington Post via Getty Images)With the rapid adoption of payment apps and services, Chopra says there are questions around how some services decide to kick a merchant or user off the platform, or whether they're collecting data through our phones to move towards personalized pricing.""We have also noticed that, for example, on the Apple devices, only Apple Pay is allowed to use that near-field communication on the device,"" said Chopra.""We hear from other potential competitors, even financial companies, they want to start their own competing apps, but they can't easily break in because they can't always use that tap function.""Story continues""When you can know every single transaction that someone has spent, that's really a map of their mind and their financial life. And I think people want to make sure that that is safe and secure and only shared when they want it to be.""While online payment systems from the likes of Venmo to Apple Pay have gained popular traction with consumers, regulators are watching stablecoins to understand if they could scale quickly. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a fiat currency, such as the dollar.When asked whether FSOC should designate stablecoins as a systemic risk, Chopra said ""at a minimum, that could provide a bit more visibility into what is backing these stablecoins.""In the midst of three U.S. bank failures last month, the largest U.S. stablecoin issuer, Circle, broke its peg to the dollar briefly before recovering.By law, FSOC can designate certain payment activities, payment clearing, and settlement as either systemic or likely to become systemic.Circle logo is seen in this illustration taken March 31, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationIn November 2021, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets recommended FSOC look at designating certain stablecoin activities as systemically important or those that are likely to become systemically important.House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry and Ranking Member Maxine Waters are expected to soon introduce legislation to regulate stablecoins.""I think Facebook's Libra proposal from several years ago was a huge wake up call to regulators around the world that if some sort of virtual currency or stablecoin was on a big tech network, it could rapidly become something that is very big and that is something we would need to be prepared for,"" Chopra said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated QuotesSymbolLast PriceChange% ChangeAAPLApple Inc.165.77-0.40-0.24%AMZNAmazon.com, Inc.102.76+0.35+0.34%GOOGAlphabet Inc.105.04+0.13+0.13%GOOGLAlphabet Inc.104.64+0.28+0.27%METAMeta Platforms, Inc.212.84-0.23-0.11%TRENDING 1.

The committee was formed to examine the growing influence of the Chinese government.On this trip lawmakers hope to send a warning shot to big American companies about their dependence on China and urge them to be more mindful of human rights issues. They also want to make it clear they want to work constructively with companies to drive change. Lawmakers, said a source close to the committee, ""are not happy with the status quo.""The trip follows a contentious hearing last month in Washington where TikTok CEO Shou Chew was grilled by members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The hearing largely focused on whether TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance can ship U.S. users' data to China's government, which could then use it to spy on Americans.Disney's Bob Iger is expected to meet with lawmakers on Wednesday. REUTERS/Hannah McKayThe delegation headed to the West Coast this week has three days of meetings planned, starting with Iger on Wednesday afternoon. Gallagher is particularly concerned after Disney’s remake of the film “Mulan” thanked Chinese government agencies accused of extreme human rights violations in the Xinjiang province.The province is home to detention camps that have held Uighur Muslims, where detainees have allegedly been subjected to terrible human rights violations, such as torture.There will also be meetings with former movie studio execs who want to share their experiences working with China as well as discussions with venture capital firms and leaders from Alphabet's Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT) and Scale AI about supply chains and China’s approach towards emerging technologies.The visit will culminate Friday with a lunch meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. That discussion will center on concerns about the tech giant’s dependence on China, including exposure via its supply chain to genocide and forced labor. The source close to the committee said Apple needs to be more diversified.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated QuotesSymbolLast PriceChange% ChangeAAPLApple Inc.164.53+0.77+0.47%DISThe Walt Disney Company99.98+0.07+0.07%GOOGAlphabet Inc.107.51+2.56+2.44%GOOGLAlphabet Inc.107.01+2.54+2.43%MSFTMicrosoft Corporation288.36+4.02+1.41%TRENDING 1.

If you’re saying to yourself, “Wait, doesn’t Apple’s Dock do all that and more?”, you’re right. RunningAppList is like a mini-Dock that you can put at multiple places on the edges of your screen(s).RunningAppList – Mac App Store　実行中のアプリはmacOSのDockにも表示されますが、Dockはメインディスプレイに1つしか表示できないのに対し、RunningAppListはメニューバーアイコンの[New Edge Tab]から追加してディスプレイ端に複数設置することが可能で、https://applech2.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RunningAppList-for-Mac-displays-app-list.mp4RunningAppListアイコンはキーを押しながらドラッグすると場所を移動することができます。RunningAppListのリスト内にあるアプリをクリックすると、そのアプリが最前面に表示され、リスト内のアプリにファイルをドラッグ&ドロップしてファイルを開いたり、外部ディスプレイにも表示できるようになっています。　RunningAppListは2019年にWalkerさんの公式サイトで公開していたそうですが、v1.3から新たにMac App Storeで公開を開始したそうで、システム要件はmacOS 10.13 High Sierra以降のIntel/Apple Silicon Macとなっており、無料で公開されているので、興味のある方はチェックしてみてください。RunningAppList – Mac App StoreRunningAppList – James Walker’s Mac Stuff スポンサーリンクDock, MacAppStore, macOS, アプリ, レビュー, 無料@applechinfo スポンサーリンク AppleのMagic KeyboardとMagic TrackpadをMacBookの様に一体化できる「Tyonit Harmony Tray」が発売。Apple WatchからChatGPTを使える「Petey (旧watchGPT)」がiPhoneに対応。 コメントをどうぞ コメントをキャンセルメールアドレスが公開されることはありません。 ※ が付いている欄は必須項目です名前 メール サイト  Δemail confirm*post date*複数のスパムフィルタをかけていますので、コメントが反映されない場合はコンタクトフォームでご連絡下さい。  ブログ内検索 人気記事 macOS 13.3 Venturaのディスクユーティリティでもボリューム名に「名称未設定」や「ボリューム」を設定するとexFATフォーマットに失敗するので注意を。  ポモドーロテクニックとApple Music/Spotifyを組み合わせたMac用タイマーアプリ「Music Timer」がリリース。  米Satechi、一体型のProハブも接続可能なMacBook Air用ケース「Eco-Hardshell Case for MacBook Air M2」を発売。  Anker Japan、最大30W出力のUSB-Cと22.5WのUSB-Aポートを搭載したカーチャージャー「Anker 323 Car Charger (52.5W)」を発売。  米Anker、Soundcoreブランドから世界初のハイレゾ＆空間オーディオに対応したポータブルBluetoothスピーカー「Motion X600」を発表。  Apple Pencilに対応しテキストやPDFにスケッチや注釈を追加できるようになったMarkdownエディタ「Ulysses v30 for Mac/iPhone, iPad」がリリース。  macOS 13.3 Venturaなどで濁点やアクセント記号がファイル名に入ったダウンロードファイルが開けない問題は「Safari」を利用することで解決する。  AppleのVirtualizationフレームワークによりApple M1チップ搭載のMacでmacOS VMの作成をサポートした「UTM v3.0.1 (Beta)」がリリース。  アプリを起動するとゲーム「Untitled Goose Game」のガチョウに似たガチョウが現れ、デスクトップを荒らしマウスカーソルを連れ去ってしまう「Desktop Goose」のMac版がリリース。  MacやWindowsからApple TVを操作できるElectron製アプリ「ATV Desktop Remote」がリリース。  ホームMacアプリiPhoneiPadAppleTVガジェットiCloudNewsレビュー不具合セキュリティコンタクトフォーム                 Copyright©  AAPL Ch.

Supply and demand are two of the most fundamental concepts in economics, and their interaction is key to determining the price of a product in a free market as well as to understanding the way markets work. Keep reading to learn more about the law of supply and demand and how it applies to everyday decisions.Image source: Getty ImagesWhat is the law of supply and demand?What is the law of supply and demand?The law of supply and demand is an economic theory asserting that supply and demand will meet each other at a certain equilibrium price. At its most fundamental level, the theory states that if supply goes down or demand goes up, prices will rise. If supply goes up or demand goes down, prices will fall.The relationship between supply, demand, and price is one of the most important in economics, and it informs business decisions and public policy.How does the law of supply and demand work?How does the law of supply and demand work?In practice, the law of supply and demand is readily visible in multiple industries. Travel-related companies, such as hotels and airlines, will raise prices according to demand, which fluctuates over the course of the year.For example, if you wanted to visit New Orleans during Mardi Gras, you would expect to pay a higher rate for a hotel than you would at another time of year. Why? Because the supply of hotel rooms is fixed, but demand spikes when there is an event or festival in a city.As a consumer, there’s no way to change the law of supply and demand, but you can take advantage of opportunities when demand is low and supply is high to save money.How the law of supply and demand affects youAs a consumer and an investor, the law of supply and demand has a direct affect on your personal finances. If you’re seeking to take advantage of low prices, you’ll want to time your purchase to when demand is lowest and supply is highest.For example, if you’re in the market for a rental apartment, you can get lower prices by looking in the winter when demand is lower. People tend to prefer to move in the summer when the weather is nicer, and the nature of the school schedule means that it’s also easier for families with school-age children to move then. Because the summer season is more competitive for moving, prices will be higher for rental properties.As an investor, supply and demand is also worth considering. A company like Apple (AAPL  -0.98%), for example, is able to charge high prices because there is so much demand for its smartphone and other devices.What is the Time Value of Money (TVM)?Whether budgeting or investing, understanding this concept can help you manage your money.What Is Inflation?Yes, it means rising prices and more, but what causes it, and why is it important to understand?What Is Revenue?The first number seen on a company's income statement, revenue is key to stock analysis.What Is Gross Profit?To gauge a company's pricing power, look to the gross profit metric.Supply and demand in the real worldSupply and demand in the real worldOne good example of supply and demand can be seen on ticket resale websites such as StubHub. Sellers set prices based on existing supply and demand, and they will adjust them based on how supply and demand change.Unlike most products, event tickets have an expiration date. So prices tend to fall as the date of the event approaches because sellers want to make sure they sell their tickets. In this case, supply outstrips demand, lowering prices.Another example is the price of commodities, which tend to go in cycles, depending on supply and demand. Egg prices spiked when avian flu spread and decimated the hen population; the prices of oil and natural gas are also cyclical, depending on global economic demand and available demand.The laws of supply and demand are also on display in the stock market. Prices rise when investor demand exceeds supply and drop when demand falls and investors want a lower price to buy the stock.If you’re preparing for the next bull market, understanding the law of supply and demand will help you take advantage of it.Jeremy Bowman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn MoreAmazon's shareholders could be set for a monster gain over the next 10 years.Amazon (AMZN 3.03%) stock might be down 44% from its all-time high right now, but it's still the fifth most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of $1.06 trillion. It's trailing its American peers in the technology sector, like Apple (AAPL -0.98%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.12%) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 0.11%) (GOOG 0.01%), yet in 2022, Amazon generated more revenue than all of them.It operates an incredibly diverse business and is dominating some of the most important areas of the technology industry. With that in mind, there's a clear path for Amazon to achieve a $5 trillion valuation in the next 10 years. If it gets there, investors who buy its stock today would earn a whopping 371% return. Amazon: Its past and futureAmazon is a widely recognized pioneer in the e-commerce industry. It began selling books online in 1995 and has never looked back. Its website is now home to millions of different products and generated $220 billion in sales in 2022 alone. But the company's expansion into other areas has supercharged its growth.It's now a leader in the cloud computing industry through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, which helps business customers with their digital transformations. It began as a way to help companies store their data online in 2006 and now offers hundreds of solutions, including advanced artificial intelligence and machine-learning tools. Last year, AWS delivered $80 billion in revenue and is consistently responsible for all of Amazon's operating income. The cloud attracts more spending from businesses each year as the number of tasks it can migrate online continues to grow. The industry was worth $484 billion in 2022, and an estimate by Grand View Research suggests it could become a $1.5 trillion annual opportunity by 2030. But Amazon hasn't stopped there. It now reports its advertising revenue as a stand-alone line item (it was once reported under its retail business), and much to investors' delight, it generated $37 billion in revenue last year. Amazon.com is the primary driver, with 2.2 billion monthly website visits, which makes it an ideal place for merchants to market their products.However, thanks to Amazon's growing portfolio of media assets like streaming -- which includes live sports from the NFL to European soccer -- its ad business might just be getting warmed up. According to Microsoft, digital advertising is a $500 billion annual opportunity, so Amazon has barely scratched the surface. Amazon attracts more revenue than Apple, Microsoft, and AlphabetIn 2022, Amazon generated $514 billion in total revenue. That was more than Apple ($394 billion), Microsoft ($198 billion), and Alphabet ($282 billion). So why have those three companies attracted higher valuations? In the case of Apple and Microsoft, they're worth more than twice as much as Amazon. Amazon has typically balanced growth and profitability really well, but unfortunately, due to a paper loss in 2022 on its passive investment in electric-vehicle maker Rivian Automotive, the company delivered its first annual net loss since 2014. That sets it apart from its three tech-giant peers because they all have consistently delivered a profit, even in this difficult economic climate.Additionally, investors fear there could be a global economic recession on the horizon. Consumers typically suffer the most in those circumstances. Since Amazon is heavily reliant on e-commerce, sales could suffer a slowdown. Plus, growth in AWS has slowed over the last few quarters. Since that segment is the profitability engine behind Amazon, as a whole, investors might be preparing for sluggish earnings results. However, AWS should be able to use its leadership position to capture an outsized share of the enormous growth forecast for the cloud computing industry over the longer term.Image source: Getty Images.Amazon's (mathematical) path to a $5 trillion valuationSince Amazon didn't generate positive earnings (profit) last year, let's focus on its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio as a valuation metric. This is calculated by dividing the company's current market value of $1.06 trillion by its 2022 revenue of $514 billion.Based on that equation, its P/S ratio is 2.1 right now. Assuming it remained constant for the next 10 years, Amazon would have to generate $2.5 trillion in revenue in 2033 to justify a $5 trillion valuation. It would have to grow its revenue by 17.1% each year between now and then to achieve that number. The good news is, since the company's initial public offering (IPO) in 1997, it has grown its revenue at a compound annual rate of 38.5%. That's well above the threshold, but more recently, its revenue growth rate in 2022 was just 8.4% and is expected to come in at 12.4% this year. Granted, that's in the middle of an incredibly difficult economic environment. Therefore, two pathways could take Amazon to a $5 trillion valuation. First, it might find its e-commerce revenue reaccelerating once the economy improves. Plus, its growth rate could be bolstered by greater cloud adoption and through the expansion of its digital-advertising business. Second, there's a phenomenon referred to as multiple expansion. Amazon stock has declined so steeply amid the broader tech sell-off that its P/S ratio is near the cheapest levels in nine years. It traded as high as 4.6 in 2020. If it climbs back to that level, Amazon will only need $1.1 trillion in revenue by 2033 to justify a $5 trillion valuation. Amazon's business mix is dominated by industries of the future, so it has the firepower to deliver robust growth for the decade ahead. But it will likely get some help from an improving economy, which should see Amazon stock attract a higher valuation, especially if the company returns to profitability (as is expected). All in all, there could be exciting gains on the table for Amazon's shareholders. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn MoreIt sometimes pays to follow the lead of successful people.Billionaires make their fortunes in all sorts of ways. For some, it came partly thanks to their ability to lead or invest in excellent companies. These are the billionaires I want to focus on today. That's because the non-billionaires out there (there are way more of us than there are of them), can sometimes learn something by looking at the kinds of equities that billionaires invest in, including dividend stocks.There is no shortage of corporations that pay dividends, but they aren't all created equal. Which ones do billionaires like? Let's look at three dividend stocks that got the investing attention of some billionaires: Gilead Sciences (GILD 2.22%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.12%), and Apple (AAPL -0.98%).1. Gilead SciencesGilead Sciences is a leading biotech company with a particular focus on the HIV drug market. It also features among the holdings of Citadel Advisors, a hedge fund run by billionaire investor Ken Griffin. What makes Gilead Sciences an attractive dividend stock? It isn't just the company's yield, although, at 3.6%, it is much higher than the average for the S&P 500 of 1.74%.Neither is it that Gilead Sciences has raised its quarterly payouts by 31.6% in the past five years. The best part about this biotech is how solid and reliable its business is. Gilead Sciences' portfolio of HIV medicines makes it one of the absolute leaders in this market. For instance, Biktarvy is the top prescribed medicine in this area in the U.S. Descovy is equally successful in the HIV PrEP market.Gilead Sciences' latest breakthrough in this area is called Sunlenca, a six-month, long-acting regimen that happens to be the first of its kind. Many HIV medicines are administered monthly or bi-monthly. A bi-annual option will undoubtedly attract many eligible patients. Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences' oncology unit is making headway thanks to products such as Trodelvy.The company has plenty of programs in the pipeline that will allow it to increase its revenue and earnings over time. Like its peers in the biotech industry, Gilead Sciences offers essential products -- lifesaving medicines no one wants to cut back on even when the economy is in shambles. This factor allows the drugmaker to generate somewhat stable revenue and earnings. That's why income-seeking investors definitely can't go wrong with this stock. And with a cash payout ratio of 44.5%, Gilead Sciences has more than enough cash to cover increasing dividend payments. 2. MicrosoftMicrosoft needs no introduction, nor does its co-founder and former CEO, Bill Gates. The billionaire largely made his fortune as a major shareholder and the head of this company. Even though he retired from this role long ago, Gates' nonprofit organization, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, owns shares of the tech giant.Why should dividend-seeking investors consider Microsoft? Let's first look at the company's operations. Microsoft is known for being the leader in computer operating systems, with an undisputed and large lead over any serious competitor.The suite of productivity tools it offers is ubiquitous and has become entrenched in the lives of millions of people, granting the company high switching costs. That includes some like Microsoft Teams that rose in popularity amid the pandemic. It is difficult to imagine Microsoft being knocked out of its leading position in this market.But Microsoft's business extends beyond that. It has become one of the largest players in the cloud computing industry through Microsoft Azure. There is a large opportunity here as the cloud market is rapidly expanding thanks to the advantages it confers to businesses, which include lowering costs and improving efficiency.Then there is Microsoft's gaming unit, which will remain an important player whether or not the blockbuster acquisition of video game giant Activision Blizzard goes through. Microsoft's leadership in multiple industries, including at least one with excellent prospects (cloud computing), makes its business strong and capable of sustaining its dividend. The company's quarterly payouts have soared by 61.9% in the last half-decade. Even with a low yield of just 0.95%, Microsoft is an excellent dividend stock.3. AppleApple has been a regular on the list of holdings of billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway for a while now. The Oracle of Omaha has even referred to the tech giant as ""probably the best business"" he knows in the world. There is a good reason for that. Apple has a knack for transforming (often by improving) already existing tech, putting its own spin on it to render it even more popular.That's what it did with the iPhone, which remains its biggest money maker. Apple's brand name is so powerful that it generates decent sales even in challenging economic times like last year. Its products hardly fall under the ""necessary goods"" category and have plenty of cheaper competitors. But beyond Apple's hardware business, the company's services segment is perhaps its most promising.Apple offers Apple Pay, Apple TV+, iCloud, Apple Music, and much more. Last year, the company's total active devices reached the 2 billion mark. That is a massive number. Investors should expect Apple to find new ways to monetize this ecosystem in this highly profitable and high-margin segment that will continue growing for years. But what about Apple's dividend?The company's yield of 0.55% does not look very impressive either, but with a solid business backing it and the regular and massive cash flow Apple generates -- which currently stands at $97.5 billion -- Apple's payouts are secure. The tech giant has increased its dividends by 26% in the past five years. Its low cash payout ratio of 15.3% leaves plenty of room for more hikes.Investors can buy Apple's stock for both growth and income.Prosper Junior Bakiny has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreThis FAANG stock-heavy index fund could skyrocket when the next bull market comes around.The S&P 500 nosedived into a bear market last year as recession fears rattled Wall Street, and the benchmark index is still down 15% from all-time highs. But every bear market has ended in a new bull market, and the same outcome is all but inevitable this time around. That makes the current situation a buying opportunity for patient investors, and the FAANG stocks look attractive.All five FAANG stocks crushed the S&P 500 over the past decade, and each one retains solid prospects for future growth. Investors can get significant exposure to the FAANG stocks through a specific Vanguard index fund. Of course, buying the stocks outright is also an option, but three of the five underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years, while the Vanguard index fund in question outperformed.The future looks bright for the FAANG stocksThe bull case for each FAANG stock is detailed below.Apple (AAPL -0.98%) led the world in smartphone and smartwatch sales in the fourth quarter. Its lineup of trendy devices inspired immense consumer loyalty, and the company recently surpassed 2 billion active devices worldwide. That hints at strong growth for its services business in the coming years. Indeed, App Store spending is forecast to climb at 14% annually through 2026, and Apple Pay is the most popular in-store mobile wallet in the U.S., meaning Apple should be a major beneficiary as smartphone payments become more prevalent at physical points of sale.Amazon (AMZN 3.03%) dominates the e-commerce industry. Its marketplace powered 38% of online retail sales in North America and Western Europe last year, and its massive logistics footprint gives the company an edge over its peers. But the company has more exciting growth prospects in the higher-margin industries of cloud computing and digital advertising. Amazon is the largest provider of cloud services, and it has quietly become the fourth-largest digital advertising company in the world in the world.Alphabet (GOOG 0.01%) (GOOGL 0.11%) dominates the ad tech space, and its valuable internet real estate should keep it at the forefront of the industry for years to come. Google Search holds an astounding 93% share in internet search, which effectively makes it the gateway to the internet, and YouTube is the top U.S. streaming service as measured by viewing time. Additionally, Google Cloud Platform is the third-largest provider of cloud services.Meta Platforms (META -0.08%) is the second-largest digital advertising company in the world. Its family of social media apps reached an incredible 3.7 billion people monthly in the fourth quarter, and Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook ranked among the 10 most downloaded mobile apps worldwide last year. Meta should be a major beneficiary of ongoing growth in digital ad spend, but its investments in generative AI and the metaverse could also pay off in the future.Netflix (NFLX 0.81%) leads the streaming industry in global engagement, revenue, and profits, and its ability to create binge-worthy content far surpasses that of its peers. The company accounted for 40% of consumer demand for original content last year, more than the next five streaming services combined, and Netflix produced 13 of the top 15 original streaming programs. While the company eschewed advertising for years, its recent launch of an ad-support service significantly expands its total addressable market.The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETFThe Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK 0.15%) tracks nearly 100 of the largest U.S. growth stocks. Its constituents include all five FAANG stocks, which collectively account for 31% of its weighted exposure, but it also includes Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia, which account for another 21% of its weighted exposure. That diversity makes the Vanguard ETF a little less risky than owning the FAANG stocks outright, though investors still get heavy FAANG exposure, as detailed below.Apple: 15.8%Alphabet: 7.1%Amazon: 5.8%Meta Platforms: 1.4%Netflix: 1.1%The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF crushed the broader market over the past decade. While the S&P 500 produced a total return of 219%, the Vanguard ETF soared 280%, or 14.2% annually. If that pace continues, $200 invested weekly would grow into $203,000 over the next decade and $969,000 in two decades. Of course, annualized returns of 14.2% are probably unsustainable over a 20-year period, but investors can reasonably expect the Vanguard ETF to beat the broader market in the long run.The last thing investors need to know is that the Vanguard ETF bears a below-average expense ratio of 0.07%, meaning the annual fees would total $7 on a $10,000 portfolio. In short, this ETF is a cheap way to diversify across dozens of the biggest growth stocks on the market, which makes it a great option for risk-tolerant investors with a long time horizon.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Shares of many tech penny stocks have fallen in the last year amid a broader slowdown in the sector, while the benchmark Invesco S&P SmallCap Information Technology ETF (PSCT) has fallen 2% and the Russell 1000 Index has dropped by 8%.Here are the top tech penny stocks in three categories: best value, fastest growth, and best performance. All statistics throughout are as of April 6.  Best Value Tech Penny Stocks These are the tech penny stocks with the lowest 12-month trailing (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. For companies in early stages of development or industries suffering from major shocks, this can be substituted as a rough measure of a business's value. A business with higher sales eventually could produce more profit when it either achieves or returns to profitability. The P/S ratio shows how much you're paying for the stock for each dollar of sales generated.Best Value Tech Penny Stocks Price ($)Market Capitalization (Market Cap) ($M)12-Month Trailing P/S RatioRackspace Technology Inc. (RXT)1.77376.70.1Conduent Inc. (CNDT)3.33727.30.2Compass Inc. (COMP)3.201.50.2Source: YChartsRackspace Technology Inc.: Rackspace Technology is a cloud computing company that provides multi-cloud solutions to help businesses manage their applications, data, and information security infrastructure. Rackspace reported revenue of $3.1 billion in 2022, up 4% year over year on new customer acquisitions and growing customer spending. The company's stock plunged in the last year on disappointing earnings results.Conduent Inc.: Conduent sells human resources and other business services to customers in the industrial, transportation, and government sectors, including more than 500 government entities. Revenue fell by 6% for the fourth quarter of 2022 amid inflation and interest rate increases, while Conduent stock approached a three-year low in March.Compass Inc.: Compass is a real estate technology firm that operates an online platform to help sell, buy, and rent real estate. Compass shares have lost more than half their value in the last year on missed earnings estimates and weak guidance.  Fastest-Growing Tech Penny Stocks These are the tech penny stocks with the highest year-over-year (YOY) sales growth for the most recent quarter. Rising sales can help investors pick out growing startups that have not yet reached profitability.In addition, earnings per share (EPS) can be significantly influenced by accounting factors that may not reflect the overall strength of the business. However, sales growth can also be potentially misleading about the strength of a business, because growing sales on money-losing businesses can be harmful if the company has no plan to reach profitability.Many smaller companies post losses over a sustained period as they invest in growing their market share and revenue. Companies with sales growth of 1,000% or more have been excluded from our list as outliers.Fastest Growing Tech Penny Stocks Price ($)Market Cap ($M)Revenue Growth (%)Grab Holdings Inc. (GRAB)3.0311,635.2311.5Stem Inc. (STEM)4.92750.5194.5Velo3D Inc. (VLD)1.95375.2186.1Source: YChartsGrab Holdings Inc.: Based in Singapore, Grab Holdings provides a ""superapp"" in countries throughout Southeast Asia, offering delivery, financial, business, and mobility services. For the full year of 2022, the company reported year-over-year revenue growth of 112%, reaching an annual total of around $1.4 billion. Revenue growth was driven by the company's Mobility and Deliveries segments, among other factors.Stem Inc.: Stem is a clean energy tech company that operates an AI-based software platform for the management of clean energy assets including solar, EV fleet charging, and more. Stem's revenue almost tripled for the final quarter of 2022 on gains in hardware sales thanks to partnership agreements.Velo3D Inc.: Velo3D is a metal 3D printing technology firm offering print preparation software, printers and other hardware, and quality control services. Revenue of $29.8 million for the last quarter of 2022 was almost triple that of the prior year's quarter. Increases in system volume and average selling prices helped to drive performance.  Tech Penny Stocks With the Best Performance These are the tech penny stocks that had the smallest declines in total return over the past 12 months out of the companies we looked at.Tech Penny Stocks With the Best Performance Price ($)Market Cap ($M)12-Month Trailing Total Return (%)DiDi Global Inc.

It also offers food delivery, intra-city freight, and financial services. DiDi shares rose in recent months as the Chinese government has eased restrictions on its user registration process, but the stock remains down substantially compared with several years ago.Nokia Oyj: Nokia is a Finnish technology, communications, and consumer goods company providing mobile phones, network infrastructure, software, and similar products. Nokia is benefiting from demand from phone companies for its 5G network infrastructure even as it has missed profit forecasts.Real Matters Inc.: Real Matters is a Canadian real estate software platform provider. It offers property valuation, risk management, data analytics, and related services to appraisers, lenders, and originators in North America.   Advantages of Tech Penny Stocks  Growth Potential: Tech penny stocks provide significant growth potential due to their micro market capitalizations and product adoption prospects.Smaller Investment: Investors don't need much capital to start trading tech penny stocks. A few hundred dollars can buy thousands of shares, allowing investors to profit quickly if the price moves in their favor. For instance, a trader who invests $200 into a 5-cent stock receives 4,000 shares. If the stock doubles in price, the trader has made a 100% gain on their small initial investment. By comparison, if the trader invested the same amount in a large-cap tech stock like Apple Inc. (AAPL), they could buy only one share, making it difficult to generate significant returns on their starting capital.   Risks of Technology Penny Stocks  Less Regulation: Tech penny stocks that trade over-the-counter (OTC), such as pink sheet listings, carry significantly higher risks than those that trade on regulated exchanges. Smaller tech companies may choose to sell their shares OTC to avoid the higher costs and regulatory requirements of listing on a major exchange like the Nasdaq. Fewer reporting obligations could make it difficult to find the necessary financial information to make informed decisions before investing in these stocks. Those who trade via OTC networks should ensure that they conduct their due diligence on the tech penny stocks they invest in to reduce the chance of getting scammed.Low Liquidity: Tech penny stocks typically trade significantly less volume than their larger-cap counterparts due to fewer market participants following these smaller companies. Lower volume can make it difficult to enter and exit positions, especially when the stock price falls sharply and traders are looking to exit their positions as quickly as possible. Insufficient liquidity can also increase trading costs through wider bid/ask spreads. For instance, a trader wanting to purchase a tech penny stock with a 50-cent to 75-cent bid/offer faces a 50% spread to execute a market order. Finally, thinner trading volumes make it easier for bad actors to manipulate the prices of tech penny stocks, which can cause sudden volatility spikes.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

You would never guess the farm’s owner set in motion a $5 trillion force that grows each fortnight.Don’t Miss: This Startup Built the World's First AI Marketing Platform That Can Understand Emotion and Some of the Biggest Companies on the Planet Are Already Using ItIt’s a comfortable enough retirement, but Ted Benna has some regrets.“I created a monster,” he said in 2016.The Tax Loophole Transforming 50 Million RetirementsIn the fall of 1980, Benna was a workplace benefits consultant who noticed a loophole in the U.S. tax code.As it was originally written, section 401(k) limited executives’ use of cash-deferred plans. But Benna saw that the section could be interpreted to let employers deduct a portion of their employees’ salary from paychecks pretax and direct it to their retirement fund.“I had only one thought at the time,” Benna recalled. “How could I make this sucker fly?”The concept of the 401(k) had some hurdles to overcome. The Internal Revenue Service still had to bless Benna’s interpretation of the tax code. And many big consulting firms dismissed the idea as a scam.To stay updated with top startup investments, sign up for Benzinga’s Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterBut the idea caught on. By the mid-1980s, half of all firms either offered or were considering offering 401(k) plans to their workers. By 1990, 401(k) plans had $384 billion in assets and 19 million active participants.Today, 50 million Americans have 401(k)s.And for stock markets around the world, this is an enormous deal.Most workers are paid every two weeks — so every fortnight, hundreds or thousands of dollars from 50 million Americans’ paychecks are diverted to the stock market.Story continuesWhen tens of billions of dollars hit markets at once, they rise as a result of this buying pressure.Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is above 34,000 — a more than 3,500% return since the birth of the 401(k).See Also: The House-Printing Robot Shaking Up a $7.28 Trillion IndustryBut there’s a danger to this massive run. Many funds are required by law to invest in S&P 500 companies like Apple that are already behemoths — inflating their valuations and making them worse deals for investors.This rule, which makes blue chip stocks more expensive for everyone, is something to think about the next time you think about buying shares of a stock like Apple, Tesla Inc. or McDonald’s Corp.Using it to your advantageThanks to changes in federal law, it’s possible for anyone to invest in pre-IPO opportunities letting the system work for you. This means you can invest in companies before they hit the stock market, and the hundreds of billions being poured into the stock market every year from retirements can work for you from the beginning. Platforms like StartEngine and Wefunder allow anyone to invest in startups before they hit the stock market.For example, RAD AI built the worlds first AI marketing platform built to understand emotion. The company has already raised over $3.3 million.See more on startup investing from Benzinga.The Startup Behind The Automated Future Of The Fast-Food IndustryTaking on the Trillion Dollar IoT Market: One Startup Says AI-Based Data Compaction Can Increase Bandwidth by 300%Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Fernando Silva | Apr 14 2023 - 12:09 pm PT												79 Comments						Earlier this year, Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway have double downed on their Apple stock position, revealing that they had purchased an additional $3 billion worth of Apple stock. That means they now own about 5.8% of all AAPL shares in circulation, valued at about $137 billion. Since investing in Apple in 2016, he has spoken about the brand in very high regard. He views Apple as a lifestyle brand more than an actual technology company. Our very own Chance Miller wrote about a recent interview between CNBC and Warren Buffet. Warren Buffet spoke about his investments in Apple as well as why he believes so strongly in the company. He continued to mention that Apple was a “wonderful business” that benefits both its customers as well as its investors.The power of the Apple brandWarren Buffet spoke extremely highly about Apple CEO Tim Cook, saying that Cook “has managed that company in an extraordinary way.” He continues to increase revenue numbers and increase product adoption, but most importantly, he is able to create repeat customers and have those customers buy even more Apple products in different categories. It all starts with the iPhone, and once the customer gets their foot in the Apple door, they continue to build their Appel product portfolio. One comment that really stuck out to me during Warren Buffett’s interview that Chance highlighted in his article was that Apple’s superpower was brand loyalty. He went on to say that people wouldn’t give up their iPhones for even $10,000. That comment really got me thinking, how much would I need to get in order to give up my iPhone for good? Was it $10,000? Was it $100,000? Was it even more? Personally, I am fully aware that I cover Apple products as a job, so I indirectly generate revenue by using my iPhone as well as other Apple products. As a result, my number might be different from someone who just uses their iPhone as any other smartphone. But I was curious to know what other iPhone users would do. If presented with a chance to take financial compensation to not only give up your iPhone but also never be able to buy any future iPhones, how much would you need?PollFinal thoughtsIt’s a tough question to answer. You would be giving up some Apple iPhone features like Airdrop, iMessage, the best mobile video, and more. But most importantly, you would give up the centerpiece of what people call the “Apple Walled Garden – that ecosystem Apple has created where their devices magically talk to each other is Apple’s secret weapon.So what would you do? Would you give up the right to own an iPhone for a certain amount of money? If the $1,000,000 isn’t enough, then how much would you need?

Apple Breakfast		 By David Price, Editor,    Macworld APR 17, 2023 3:52 am PDT  Image: Foundry Welcome to our Apple Breakfast column, which includes all of the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup. We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a morning cup of coffee or tea, but it’s cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too.Deal or no deal?The last person you should ask for money advice, I would have thought, is a billionaire. Sure, they have a proven track record of acquiring and holding on to loads of money, but I have my doubts about their ability to grasp its value to the rest of us. I’m not convinced they understand the stakes.Such were my thoughts this week, while reading the news that Warren Buffett (at one point reportedly the wealthiest human on the planet, but now languishing down around fifth place) reckons the average iPhone user would refuse to switch to Android even if offered $10,000. A point of view which gets a chinny reckon so big it can be seen from space."" @tim_cook is one of the classiest CEOs and he understands the business. Tim Cook has managed that company in an extraordinary way,"" says Warren Buffett on $AAPL. ""It's a wonderful business so we own a lot of it."" pic.twitter.com/1lVUNIfgnT— Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) April 12, 2023“If you’re an Apple user,” he told Becky Quick on CNBC’s Squawk Box this week, “and somebody offers you $10,000, and the only proviso is that they’ll take away your iPhone and you’ll never be able to buy another, you’re not going to take it.”Warren Buffett, of course, doesn’t need the $10,000 and may find it difficult to put himself in the shoes of someone who does. I would say there are probably quite a few people out there still hanging on to a battered iPhone 6s who’d jump at the chance to cash it in for that kind of money, and happily spend the first chunk on one of several top-end Android handsets. But the money isn’t exactly Buffet’s point. Rather, as a tech user, are you willing to venture outside your comfort zone? And at what point does loyalty become a fault?Full disclosure time, and get ready for a shock: I’m an iPhone user. I’m currently running an iPhone 14 Pro that Macworld got in for review last fall, and I had a 13 Pro and a 12 Pro before that. I don’t always get the flagship models (I spent a very happy year with the 8 Plus after the iPhone X came out) but it’s fair to say that I’m an unusually privileged Apple user who nearly always gets access to extremely recent and high-end iPhone models. If anyone should have a rose-tinted view of the iPhone ecosystem, it’s me.And you know what? I’d totally take that deal. I’d negotiate, of course: I reckon I could squeeze Buffett for six figures. But if he played hardball I’d still walk out of the room with the 10 grand and a smile on my face.Here’s the thing. iPhones are nicely designed, generally well-specced and exceptionally user-friendly smartphones, but that’s all they are. They’re not a lifestyle, they’re not a religion, they’re not your “team.” They’re one specific flavor of a product that didn’t even exist 30 years ago, and may very well fade into commoditized irrelevance within the next 15.Now, I’m not here to argue that we don’t need smartphones at all, as manifestly true as I suspect that is. I grudgingly accept that most of us have grown to rely on their convenience and seductive distractions. But even if you need a smartphone, you don’t need an iPhone, which is simply the version of that device that I (and many others) enjoy using the most. Of course there is an emotional component to these choices, as there is to all human activities, but we should be guided by our feelings, not constrained by loyalty to a corporation that doesn’t know we exist. Assign a dollar value X to the degree of convenience and happiness that owning a high-end iPhone adds to your life. If Warren Buffett offers you a sum of money that exceeds X, you should take the deal.Would I enjoy learning to use Android, a platform I last seriously tackled the best part of a decade ago? Probably not. But between Warren Buffett’s money and Macworld’s advice on the best Android phone for iPhone users, I reckon I’d get by.FoundryTrending: Top storiesRoman Loyola explains why the 15-inch MacBook Air will be Apple’s perfect laptop.Forget iPhone 15 buttons, the whole Apple rumor mill needs to hit the reset button.Declining software quality is just one of the many issues bugging Apple users.Tim Cook has confirmed everything and nothing about Apple’s next big thing.The Apple Store has gone from a blessing to a black eye, reckons the Macalope.Looking forward to WWDC?

Learn MoreThe tech giant is finally showing signs of stress as the personal computing downturn drags on.The tech industry has been working through a glut of PC (personal computer) and smartphone inventories since the second half of 2022. Following a massive upgrade cycle fueled by the work-from-home movement in late 2020 through 2021, the chip shortage loosened up last year just in time for consumer demand to cool off (inflation being but one reason for this). PC makers responded by reducing shipments to retail partners until the excess inventory was reduced by consumer purchasing. One standout winner during this mess last year was Apple (AAPL -0.98%), but it appears the downturn finally came for the iPhone and Mac company.Does this mean it's time to sell Apple stock? Apple Macs plunge more than peers?According to data from tech research firm IDC, global PC shipments in first-quarter 2023 fell a whopping 29% year over year to 56.9 million. This isn't just a dip below COVID-era highs (80.2 million global PC shipments in Q1 2022, and over 90 million global shipments during the fourth-quarter holiday shopping frenzy of 2021 and 2020). If IDC's preliminary Q1 2023 figures are correct, 56.9 million PCs would represent a 4% decline from 59.2 million shipments in Q1 2019, and a 6% decline from 60.6 million PCs in Q1 2018. Indeed, this is a steep pullback from the rampant consumer tech spending spree over the last couple of years.But what may be especially concerning for investors is to see Apple PCs (like Macs and MacBook laptops) fall precipitously, at least according to IDC. The research company's preliminary estimate is that Q1 2023 Apple Mac shipments plunged 40% year over year to just 4.1 million units. That's a far steeper drop than the other top PC makers on the list: Lenovo, HP, Dell Technologies, and ASUS.  Don't panic just yetThere's a caveat to Apple's PC shipments plunging far more than its peers, though. Macs and MacBooks are premium personal computers, but people are still willing to shell out the extra cash for the Apple emblem. According to IDC's estimates, Apple still commands the No. 4 spot as far as global PC market share goes, behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell.  Apple's market share of Q1 2023 PC shipments was 7.2%. Though that's down from its low-teens percentage market share high reached at points in 2022, Apple is nevertheless holding on to its progress. In Q1 2019, before the pandemic started, Apple was in the No. 5 position in market share. At that time, it only shipped 3.9 million Macs and MacBooks, according to IDC estimates, giving it a global PC market share of only 6.6%. Quarter-to-quarter shipments can be noisy and distracting. Thus, though Apple PC revenue might be in for some pain when the next quarter's financials are released (the report comes out May 4, 2023), it appears that Apple is still selling more PCs than it was pre-pandemic -- and commanding greater leadership than it was four years ago. If you own Apple stock, there's no need to panic. The market saw this coming alreadyThere's another reason to keep it cool: We already knew Apple Mac and MacBook sales were getting hit pretty hard. During the last earnings call in February 2023 (for the three-month period ended December 2022), Apple said Mac revenue had fallen 29% year over year to $7.74 billion. The reason, besides a hard-hit global consumer, was a tough comparison to the year prior thanks to the MacBook Pros featuring the brand new in-house designed Apple M-series chip. Apple is now on its second-gen M2 chip, but that isn't having the same dramatic upside as the initial M-series processor release.  Apple CFO Luca Maestri also said to expect Mac revenue to fall by a year-over-year double-digit percentage again in the first few months of 2023, for similar reasons to last quarter. No surprises, then, at IDC's ugly-looking estimates. It's also worth remembering that the iPhone matters most. iPhone sales made up 56% of Apple revenue at the end of 2022. And regardless of what devices are selling (iPhones, Macs, iPads, Watch, etc.), Apple keeps expanding its total ""installed base"" of devices in operation, which is the fuel that keeps its stable-growth ""services"" segment headed higher. Apple said it had reached over 2 billion devices in its installed base during the final months of 2022, double the figure seven years ago. Apple stock has rallied 23% so far in 2023, and is just 12% off all-time highs reached a little over a year ago. If you're an Apple shareholder, there's no reason to panic-sell the stock now.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreThe possible cancellation of an upcoming iPhone 15 feature could throttle its growth.Cirrus Logic's (CRUS -0.84%) stock price dropped 12% on April 12 on concerns that it could lose some key orders from its top customer Apple (AAPL -0.98%).In a blog post, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed Apple would likely ""abandon the closely watched solid-state button design and revert to the traditional physical button design"" in the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max due to ""unresolved technical issues."" As the exclusive producer of IC controllers for those haptic buttons, Cirrus would take a bigger hit from that rumored change than Apple's other suppliers.Loop Capital issued a similar warning, claiming that Cirrus had expected a gain of as much as $1.60 per device from those two top-tier iPhones. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vihn had previously estimated that on average, Cirrus could sell up to $7 in components to Apple for each iPhone 15, compared to an estimated $5.70 in components for each iPhone 14. If those two estimates are accurate, Cirrus could lose more than a fifth of its iPhone 15 component sales if Apple scraps its solid-state button.Image source: Getty Images.Did investors overreact to those rumors and actually create a good buying opportunity in Cirrus, which remains up nearly 20% over the past 12 months? Or does it merely highlight Cirrus' overwhelming dependence on Apple and its limited long-term growth potential?A company that couldn't survive without AppleCirrus is a market leader in audio converters and chips, but it's been developing other mixed-signal processing chips for wireless headsets, wearables, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) headsets, laptops, and mobile devices in recent years.Cirrus serves thousands of customers, but the lion's share of its revenue comes from Apple, which installs its audio chips and IC controllers in its iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It relied on Apple for 79% of its revenue in fiscal 2022 (which ended last March), 83% of its revenue in fiscal 2021, and 79% of its revenue in fiscal 2020.That puts Cirrus in the same category as other Apple suppliers like Skyworks Solutions and Lumentum, which relied on Apple for 58% and 29% of their revenues, respectively, in their latest fiscal years.Cirrus' overwhelming dependence on Apple is a double-edged sword. Its revenue rises and falls in tandem with Apple's hardware sales, but there's a constant fear that Apple will eventually split its orders with another supplier or develop in-house alternatives. Cirrus probably doesn't have much pricing power when it comes to negotiating with Apple, and it's at the mercy of its abrupt specification changes or order reductions.Apple won't replace Cirrus' chips anytime soon, but it previously used audio chips from Analog Devices' Maxim in its AirPods instead of Cirrus' chips. Therefore, investors shouldn't be too surprised if Apple eventually courts other suppliers to reduce its dependence on Cirrus' chips. How fast has Cirrus been growing?Cirrus' revenue declined in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 as the global smartphone market cooled off, but it's risen consistently over the past three years as the market stabilized. Apple's launch of the iPhone 12 (its first family of 5G devices) in 2020 aided that growth. Cirrus' gross margins also expanded as it sold a larger quantity of pricier chips.      MetricFY 2018FY 2019FY 2020FY 2021FY 2022Revenue growth(0.4%)(22.6%)11.1%6.9%30.1%Adjusted gross margin49.7%50.5%52.7%51.7%52.1%Data source: Cirrus Logic.In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, Cirrus' revenue rose 18% year over year, but supply chain headwinds and an unfavorable mix of lower-margin components reduced its adjusted gross margin from 51.8% to 50.6%. It expects its revenue to rise 5% to 8% for the full year, compared to analysts' expectations for 6% growth. Analysts expect its revenue to only rise 2% in fiscal 2024 as it laps the iPhone 15 upgrade cycle. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to decline 8% this year before rising 3% in fiscal 2024.Cirrus' growth is decelerating, but its stock looks cheap at 14 times forward earnings. However, it's still pricier than Skyworks and Lumentum, which trade at 9 and 11 times forward earnings, respectively. Moreover, Cirrus' forward valuations are still pegged to estimates that assume it can grow its content share in the iPhone 15 significantly.It's not the right time to buy CirrusCirrus Logic will likely keep growing, but I'd rather simply invest in Apple than take my chances on this cyclical supplier. Cirrus simply has too much exposure to Apple compared to Skyworks, Lumentum, and other leading iPhone suppliers, and the replacement of the solid-state button in the upcoming iPhone 15 could severely throttle its near-term growth.Leo Sun has positions in Apple.
